This is a simple interpreter of a basic programming language.

It consists of a lexer, parser and back-end evaluator.
The lexer takes a string as input and produces a list of tokens.
The parser is then fed this list, which it converts to a tree of classes.
This tree is then evaluated via small-step semantics with the evaluator.

The lexer.py file has test code with a test 'program' string to run, as an example.

It can comprehend:
  -expressions
  -variables
  -assignments
  -if statements
  -sequences of statements.

Here is the EBNF semantics:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

program = statement EOF
;

statement = sequence
    | assign
    | donothing
    | block
;

sequence = [assign|donothing|block] statement
;

block = IF expression THEN CLPAREN statement CRPAREN ELSE CLPAREN statement CRPAREN
;

assign = variable ASGN expression EOL
;

donothing = NULL EOL
;

variable = VAR
;

expression = atom OP expression
    | conditional
    | LPAREN expression RPAREN
    | atom
;

conditional = expression COMP expression
;

atom = variable
    | NUM
    | BOOL
;
